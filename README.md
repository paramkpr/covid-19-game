# covid-19-game
This is a game to educate its players on covid-19 precautions. 
This game was developed by one of my students, @MallikaDutta, after taking the introduction to programming with Python and Javascript with me. 
I wanted to show off the skills she learned after she completed her course, that is why this fork is here.
